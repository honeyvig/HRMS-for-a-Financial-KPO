Building a complete HRMS (Human Resource Management System) that integrates a web and mobile application with Python as the core technology stack involves several components. Here’s a high-level approach for developing both the mobile (using Kivy) and web (using Django or Flask) applications, along with Python code snippets for some of the functionalities.
1. Backend Implementation (Django Framework)

For the backend, we will use Django. It is a high-level Python web framework that is excellent for building secure and scalable applications.

models.py (Django Models for Employee and Payroll)

In this file, we define the data models for employee profiles and payroll information.

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Employee(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15, blank=True, null=True)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()
    date_of_joining = models.DateField()
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Attendance(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateField()
    check_in_time = models.TimeField()
    check_out_time = models.TimeField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.employee.name} - {self.date}'

class Leave(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    leave_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.employee.name} - {self.leave_type}'

views.py (Django Views for Managing Employees)

In this file, we will handle various views for employee management, attendance, and payroll.

from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Employee, Attendance, Leave
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    employees = Employee.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'dashboard.html', {'employees': employees})

@login_required
def add_employee(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.POST.get('name')
        email = request.POST.get('email')
        phone = request.POST.get('phone')
        position = request.POST.get('position')
        department = request.POST.get('department')
        salary = request.POST.get('salary')
        
        # Create employee record
        Employee.objects.create(name=name, email=email, phone=phone, position=position, department=department, salary=salary)
        return HttpResponse("Employee added successfully")

    return render(request, 'add_employee.html')

@login_required
def payroll(request):
    payroll_data = Employee.objects.all().values('name', 'salary')
    return render(request, 'payroll.html', {'payroll_data': payroll_data})

urls.py (Django URLs)

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('dashboard/', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
    path('add_employee/', views.add_employee, name='add_employee'),
    path('payroll/', views.payroll, name='payroll'),
]

2. Mobile App (Kivy Framework)

Kivy is a Python framework for developing multitouch applications. Below is a basic implementation for the mobile app that allows employees to log in and view their information.
Mobile App Code (Kivy)

First, you need to install Kivy:

pip install kivy

main.py (Main Kivy App)

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.screenmanager import ScreenManager, Screen
from kivy.uix.button import Button
from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput
from kivy.uix.label import Label
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout

class LoginScreen(Screen):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(LoginScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')

        self.username_input = TextInput(hint_text='Enter Username', size_hint=(None, None), height=40, width=200)
        self.password_input = TextInput(hint_text='Enter Password', password=True, size_hint=(None, None), height=40, width=200)
        
        login_button = Button(text='Login', size_hint=(None, None), height=40, width=200)
        login_button.bind(on_press=self.check_login)

        layout.add_widget(self.username_input)
        layout.add_widget(self.password_input)
        layout.add_widget(login_button)

        self.add_widget(layout)

    def check_login(self, instance):
        # Simulate login (this should be replaced by a real API call to authenticate users)
        username = self.username_input.text
        password = self.password_input.text
        if username == 'admin' and password == 'password':  # Simulated check
            self.manager.current = 'dashboard'

class DashboardScreen(Screen):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(DashboardScreen, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')

        # Show employee details or other data here
        employee_info = Label(text='Welcome to HRMS Dashboard', size_hint=(None, None), height=40, width=200)
        layout.add_widget(employee_info)

        self.add_widget(layout)

class HRMSApp(App):
    def build(self):
        sm = ScreenManager()
        sm.add_widget(LoginScreen(name='login'))
        sm.add_widget(DashboardScreen(name='dashboard'))
        return sm

if __name__ == '__main__':
    HRMSApp().run()

requirements.txt for Kivy

kivy==2.1.0

3. Frontend Web Application (Django + React)

You can integrate the React.js frontend with the Django backend using Django REST Framework (DRF) to build an API-based communication layer.
Django REST Framework Integration

    Install Django REST Framework:

pip install djangorestframework

    Create the API views using Django REST Framework (DRF).

from rest_framework import serializers, viewsets
from .models import Employee

class EmployeeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Employee
        fields = '__all__'

class EmployeeViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Employee.objects.all()
    serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer

    Set up API URLs for Employee API.

from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import EmployeeViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'employees', EmployeeViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', include(router.urls)),
]

React Frontend for the Web Application

    Create a React frontend to interact with the API.

npx create-react-app hrms-frontend
cd hrms-frontend
npm start

    Use Axios to fetch data from the Django API.

npm install axios

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function EmployeeList() {
  const [employees, setEmployees] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/employees/')
      .then(response => setEmployees(response.data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Employee List</h1>
      <ul>
        {employees.map(employee => (
          <li key={employee.id}>{employee.name} - {employee.position}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default EmployeeList;

Deployment

    Backend Deployment: Deploy the Django application on AWS or Google Cloud. You can use services like AWS EC2 for hosting and RDS for the database.

    Frontend Deployment: Deploy the React app on Netlify or Vercel for continuous deployment.

    Mobile App Deployment: Use Buildozer to package and deploy the Kivy mobile app for Android and iOS.

Conclusion

This solution covers the development of the HRMS system for your KPO business, including both web and mobile app functionalities. The web app uses Django and React.js, while the mobile app is built using Kivy. The backend uses Django REST Framework for API-based communication with the frontend. You can further enhance these systems with features like biometric integration, performance management, payroll systems, and detailed reporting to meet the needs of your HRMS solution.
